# Road map advanced python project "Inspectair"

## week 1 (02/05/24)
- name ✔️
- create readME and roadmap ✔️
- Set up GitHub ✔️
- Import data as dataframe with correct format
- GUI search bar for individual countries (=> user explores dataset himself/herself)
- get a basic working world map which can be coloured by coordinates 
- learn how to clean the data

## week 2 (16/05/24)
- get the map to work on our data
- get a rough form of the GUI running
- dropdown menu, user selects timeframe (=> data selection, task 2)
- GUI: Ranking of top scoring countries (rough form)
- GUI: Display basic statistics within timeframe as plots (rough form)

## week 3 (23/05/24)
- print statistics of countries air quality in graphics (not in the map, but in a different window)
- GUI: Ranking of top scoring countries (final form)
- GUI: Display basic statistics within timeframe as plots (final form)

## week 4 (30/05/24)
(- get the map to work on API data?)
- final polish, putting together 'all the pieces'
- presentation


## other ideas in case of spare time:
- Obtain simulated air patterns
- Associate high density of certain chemicals to different diseases and maybe link papers to the statistics
