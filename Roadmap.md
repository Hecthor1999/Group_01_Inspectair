## Road map project airquality python

week 1
- name 
- create readME and roadmap
- Import data as dataframe with correct format
- GUI search bar for individual countries (=> user explores dataset himself/herself)
- get a basic working world map which can be coloured by coordinates 
- learn how to clean the data

week 2
- get the map to work on our data
- get a rough form of the GUI running
- dropdown menu, user selects timeframe (=> data selection, task 2)
- GUI: Ranking of top scoring countries (rough form)
- GUI: Display basic statistics within timeframe as plots (rough form)

week 3
- print statistics of countries air quality in graphics (not in the map, but in a different window)
- GUI: Ranking of top scoring countries (final form)
- GUI: Display basic statistics within timeframe as plots (final form)

week 4
(- get the map to work on API data?)
- final polish, putting together 'all the pieces'


other ideas in case of spare time:
- Obtain simulated air patterns
- Associate high density of certain chemicals to different diseases and maybe link papers to the statistics
